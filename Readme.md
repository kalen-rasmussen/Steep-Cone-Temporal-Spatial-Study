# Steep Cone Geyser Temporal Spatial Study
The goal of this study was to determine the microbial community and geochemical dynamics in an actively silicifying hydrothermal system to better constrain endpoint conclusions made from examining the ancient, silicified rock record. To address this, geochemistry and biomass samples were collected over multiple years at set locations along an outflow channel at an actively silicifying hydrothermal feature in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). 16S rRNA and rRNA gene sequencing coupled to multiple geochemistry techniques were employed.
